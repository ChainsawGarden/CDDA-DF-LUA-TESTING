## Delta Fork's Code of Conduct
1. Write good code.
    - **ALWAYS** Ask questions!
        - Prerequisite: *Search first.*
        - If you think your code sucks, re-design it and check it again!
        - If you are unsure about how a piece of code works, and you've searched everywhere, ask! Make it public so others having similar problems may find this!
2. ...*ALWAYS* ask questions.
    - Some questions you must ask yourself first.
    - If you find your question unanswered by anyone, or unsatisfied with any such answer, by all means ask yourself, experiment, and self-evaluate.
3. Don't be a jerk.
    - Don't harass people.
    - Try to resolve conflicts quickly.
4. Try your hardest
    - No matter what, do your best. Try until you get it, because you surely will.
    - Experiment! At the very core, [follow the scientific method (as it applies everywhere)](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology)
5. Do things the hacker way
    - Duckduckgo / Qwant / Yandex / "Google" is your friend (though try **NOT** to use [google](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/google-software-bug-shared-private-online-documents-20090310-8tup.html) [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) [as](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/wifi-data-collection-update.html) [much](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-collects-a-frightening-amount-of-data-about-you-you-can-find-and-delete-it-now/) [as](https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1371509053613084679) [humanly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/03/20/stop-using-google-chrome-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-ipad-and-macbook-pro/) [possible](https://hackernoon.com/data-privacy-concerns-with-google-b946f2b7afea))
    - Always check the documentation.
    - Reverse-engineer the game, and look at what others have done.
    - Break the game, and try to fix it.
    - If you find something undocumented, ***document it!***
        - You'll be helping others that have had that same issue!
6. Leave your politics at the door.
    - Remember, we're all on the same ship. Leave everything else behind you.
7. Have fun!
